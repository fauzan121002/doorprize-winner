## Quick Start
1. Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zuramai/doorprize-winner.git
cd doorprize-winner
```
2. Run the app
```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.
